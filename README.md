# Netflix Data Scraping and Visualization using Tableau
This project is a Python script that uses web scraping and the OMDb API to get IMDb ratings for movies and TV shows in your Netflix account.

# Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. You will also need to create an OMDb API key, which you can get by signing up at http://www.omdbapi.com/.

To use this repository, you will need to have Python installed and set up with your API key. Once this is done, you can download the NetflixProject.py script and replace the placeholder "XXXXXXXX" with your information. To run the script, navigate to the directory where the script is saved and execute it from the command line. The script will prompt you to log in to your Netflix account and then scrape your account data to get the titles of the movies and TV shows you've watched.

# Usage
After running the script, a CSV file named netflix_ratings.csv will be generated. This file contains information about the movies and TV shows on your Netflix profile, along with their IMDb ratings. You can view this file in Excel or use a Tableau dashboard to interact with and visualize your data. The link to my dashboard is provided below. Simply click the link to access the dashboard:
