# Netflix-Data-Scrapping-Tableau-Dashboard
This project is a Python script that uses web scraping and the OMDb API to get IMDb ratings for movies and TV shows in your Netflix account.

# Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. You will also need to create an OMDb API key, which you can get by signing up at http://www.omdbapi.com/.

Once you have Python and your API key set up, you can download the NetflixProject.py script from this repository, add you user_agent and API key, and run it from the command line. The script will prompt you to log in to your Netflix account and then scrape your account data to get the titles of the movies and TV shows you've watched.

# Usage
After running the script, you will have a CSV file called netflix_ratings.csv that contains the information of the movies and TV shows in your Netflix profile, as well as their IMDb ratings. You can open this file in Excel or another spreadsheet program. Also, you can use the tableau dashboard to visualize and intract with the data.
